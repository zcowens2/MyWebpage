    <p style= "background-color:red"> Hi, my name is Zachary Owens but people call me Zach. I have one brother, one sister, and 2 loving parents. My pride is joy is my dog name Huck, he is a husky and german sheperd mix whom I shar a birthday with. I have been playing baseball since before I can even remember so it has always been apart of my life. My hard work and focus has paid off because I was given the oppurtunity to play baseball at the next level. I am signed to play division II baseball at Davis & Elkins in the MEC conference. Being able to continue playing while getting a large portion of college paid for is truly a blessing</p>

    <p style= "background-color:red"> Honestly I had zero intentions of taking this class. I was put into this class because I dropped AP calc because taking that class online was too much. I wanted to be put into an easy math class because I'm an athlete and I have been in advanced math my entire life so a break would've been nice. At first I was not happy whatsoever about taking a computer class but as time went on I realized that the stuff we do is kind of cool. Its pretty sick how we can make such amazing things just by coding on different platforms. </p>
